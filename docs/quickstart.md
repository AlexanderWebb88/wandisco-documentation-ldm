Want to try LiveData Migrator out and see how it works? Follow these three steps to download and install LiveData Migrator, and perform a data migration.

If you're new to the concept of LiveData, or want to know what LiveData Migrator does, see the [introduction to LiveData Migrator](./about.md).

## Before you start
You'll need a Red Hat or Debian operating system, a Java version of at least 1.8, and the following machine specifications:
* (Minimum): 4 CPU Cores / 16 GB Memory / 32 GB Temp Disk / 16GB Cache / 2GB throughput.
* (Recommended): 16 CPU Cores / 32 GB Memory / 64 GB Temp disk (SSD) / 192 GB (Premium cache storage) / very high network throughput.

[See a full list of technical prerequisites.](./installation.md#prerequisites)

## Step 1 - Download and install
<div class="download">
<a href="https://customer.wandisco.com">Download LiveData Migrator</a>
</div>

1. Install the files by running these commands:
    ```
    chmod +x one-ui_lm_*_installer.sh
    ```
    ```
    ./one-ui_lm_<package-type>_installer.sh
    ```
2. Check the service statuses by running these commands:
    ```
    /etc/init.d/live-migrator status
    ```
    ```
    /etc/init.d/one-ui-server status
    ```
1. [Connect to the UI using port 8081](./operation-ui.md#before-you-start).
1. [Register your LiveData Migrator account](./operation-ui.md#register).

## Step 2 - Define a source and a target
You'll need a source and at least one target to migrate data.
1. In the UI Storage panel, click the pulsing + button to add a source.
1. Once added, repeat the process to add a target.

See the [Configure storage](./operation-ui.md#configure-storage) guide for more details.

## Step 3 - Migrate your data
1. Choose a source and target from previously defined [storages](./operation-ui.md#configure-storage).
2. Choose the Path to set the scope of the migration.
3. [Apply any exclusions](./operation-ui.md#add-new-exclusions) to reduce the scope within this Path.

See the [Create migrations](./operation-ui.md#create-migrations) guide for more details.
